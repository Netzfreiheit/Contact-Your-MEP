Dear MEP {{name}},

I'm asking you to save net neutrality, again. 

In April 2014 the European Parliament voted in favour of clear and binding rules for net neutrality in the "Telecom Single Market" regulation. I call on you to defend this decision in the interest of the European citizens and not to let your position be watered down during the trialogue negotiations. 

The European Commission's president Jean-Claude Juncker promised a Digital Single Market and this requires strong protections for citizens and content and applications providers. 

Right now, internet users can access content from small blogs, news websites, and government websites just as easily as they can access content from big companies. But unless clear rules enshrining net neutrality and outlawing network discrimination are adopted, ISPs will be able to do what they have been lobbying for – they will be able to create fast lanes where few companies would get prioritised access to customers, leaving anyone who can't pay, such as smaller websites or educational and public services, in the slow lane. As telecoms operators would be empowered to hand pick the winners and losers in the market, this would begin a new era of online discrimination and establish an anti-competitive market in the EU. This would be a disadvantage globally, happening at the same time that US companies have been protected from such restrictions.

In 2014, the European Parliament stood with thousands of citizens who took action to fight for net neutrality. More than 40,000 faxes, thousands of e-mails, and hundreds of phone calls were sent to defend our fundamental rights online. I'm asking you to stand with me again.

Sincerely, 
A concerned citizen
