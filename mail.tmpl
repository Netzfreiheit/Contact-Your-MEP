Dear MEP {{name}},

On 27th October you will vote on the future of the Internet. This is the last chance to repair the broken Telecom Single Market Regulation. With the current trialogue agreement, the Internet in the European Union would risk falling behind the rest of the world. 

In April 2014, the European Parliament voted in favour of clear and binding rules for Net Neutrality in the "Telecom Single Market" regulation. I call on you to defend this decision, in the interest of the European citizens and vote for amendments to the trialogue agreement. The current text is so unclear that it could allow Net Neutrality violations that would stiffle freedom of speech, economic growth and innovation in the online economy. 

Today, internet users can access content from small blogs, news websites, and government websites just as easily as they can access content from big companies. But unless clear rules enshrining Net Neutrality and outlawing network discrimination are adopted, you are leaving it up to regulators to decide on the future of the Internet in Europe. In the absence of clear rules, it will be up to them  to decide if Internt access providers will be able to do what they have been lobbying for – namely, to create fast lanes where few companies would get prioritised access to customers, leaving anyone who can't pay, such as smaller websites or educational and public services, in the slow lane. 

Since the European Parliament was applauded in 2014 for its decision to defend Net Neutrality, the world has changed. The biggest online economy of the world has now strong protection for Net Neutrality with the new rules by the American regulatory agency FCC. Countries like Canada, the Netherlands, Slovenia and Chile have enforced existing Net Neutrlaity legislation and observed very positive effects on their telecom markets. Millions of people in India went to the streets to defend Net Neutrality and many Latin American countries look towards Europe in the implementation phase of their Net Neutrality legislation. Europe has to lead by example and not fall behind. 

In 2014, the European Parliament stood with thousands of citizens who took action to fight for Net Neutrality. I'm asking you to stand with me again. Please vote for amendments that repair the problems with this regulation. 

Sincerely, 
A concerned citizen
