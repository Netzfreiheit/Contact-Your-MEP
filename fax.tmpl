Dear MEP {{name}},

I'm asking you to save net neutrality, again. 

In April 2014, the European Parliament voted in favour of clear and binding rules for net neutrality in the Telecom Single Market regulation. I call on you to defend this decision in the interest of the European citizens and not to let your position be watered down during the trialogue negotiations. 

The driving force for diversity, innovation, and growth in the online economy is net neutrality. This founding principle of the internet is what guarantees European innovation and human rights online. 

Today, internet users can access content from big companies and small blogs, news sites or government websites on an equal basis. But if clear rules enshrining net neutrality and outlawing network discrimination are not adopted, ISPs will be able to do what they have been lobbying for â€“ they will be able to create fast lanes where few companies would get prioritised access to customers, leaving smaller websites, education, public services, and anyone else who can't pay, in the slow lane. As telecoms operators would be empowered to hand pick the winners and losers in the market, this would begin a new era of online discrimination and the establishment of an anti-competitive market in the EU. This would happen at the same time as US companies have just been given the certainty that they will be protected from such restrictions.

In 2014, the European Parliament stood with thousands of citizens who took action to fight for net neutrality. More than 40,000 faxes, thousands of emails, and hundreds of phone calls were sent to defend our fundamental rights online. I'm asking you to stand with me again. 

Right now, it is up to you to ensure citizens' fundamental rights and the prosperity and competitiveness of the EU Single Market by taking a strong stance in favour of net neutrality. 

Sincerely, 

A concerned citizen
